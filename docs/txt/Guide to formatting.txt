COMMAND NAME
=============
{COMMAND-NAME} is replaced with the name of the command that is called in the script.
(e.g. if you type: "test" into the terminal, it would return the output)
Curly Brackets are not required: {}
Symbols and code can be included in the command name.

------> CODE HERE
=================
------> CODE HERE is replaced with the script or function that is returned on the command call (as seen in {COMMAND-NAME})
Do not include ------> CODE HERE in the code.
